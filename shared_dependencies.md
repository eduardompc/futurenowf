1. **Scrapy**: All the files share the Scrapy framework as a dependency. Scrapy is used for creating the web scraper and handling the extraction of data.

2. **Python**: All the files are written in Python, so they share Python as a common language.

3. **Items**: The "items.py" file defines the data schema for the scraped data. This schema is used by "reddit_scraper.py", "pipelines.py", and "reddit_spider.py" to understand what data to extract and how to process it.

4. **Pipelines**: The "pipelines.py" file defines how the scraped data should be processed and stored. This is used by "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py" to send the scraped data for processing and storage.

5. **Settings**: The "settings.py" file contains settings for the Scrapy spider. These settings are used by "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py" to configure the spider.

6. **RedditSpider**: The "reddit_spider.py" file defines the RedditSpider class, which is used by "reddit_scraper.py" to initiate the scraping process.

7. **DOM Elements**: The specific DOM elements to be scraped from Reddit are shared between "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py". These might include elements like post titles, author names, upvote counts, etc.

8. **JSON**: The "output.json" file is the destination for the scraped data. The format of this data is defined by the schema in "items.py", and the process for writing to this file is defined in "pipelines.py". 

9. **Pagination and Dynamic Content Handling**: The logic and functions for handling pagination and dynamic content on Reddit are shared between "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py".
